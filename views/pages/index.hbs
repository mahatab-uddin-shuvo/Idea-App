      <p>In philosophy, ideas are usually taken as mental representational images of some object. Ideas can also be abstract
    concepts that do not present as mental images. Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental
    ontological category of being. The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an
    essential and defining feature of human beings. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous
    manner,
    even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place. A new
    or
    original idea can often lead to innovation.</p>
